**What happened?**
The Galileo app got stuck on the loading screen after leaving it open for a period of time.

**What did you expect to happen?**
I expected to return to my computer to see Galileo still running and functioning as normal.

**How can someone else reproduce this?**

  1. Open galileo
  2. Leave running in background for period of time (uncertain of duration / but likely 20+ minutes, potentially let your computer go to sleep)
  3. Re-engage with the app
  4. App stays stuck on loading circle and most be closed / re-opened to use.
